# Fed_Funds_ML

## About
This is a personal project to demonstrate whether Federal Funds rate changes can be accurately predicted 
using FOMC meetings minutes, by leveraging machine learning, primarily NLP (Natural Language Processing). 
The FOMC is the policy governing body of the US Federal Reserve Bank which is the central bank of the US.

For a detailed overview of this project see the pdf in this repo called "Fed_Funds_ML_Project_Report". 
This report includes sections on project overview, data wrangling, statistical analysis, and machine learning.

## Running the Project

Use this on the command line to start your Jupyter Notebook to get more processing power else it will stall out:

```jupyter notebook --NotebookApp.iopub_data_rate_limit=10000000000```
