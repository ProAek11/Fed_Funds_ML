  the federal open market committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 4 14 percent  despite elevated energy prices and hurricane related disruptions the expansion in economic activity appears solid  core inflation has stayed relatively low in recent months and longer term inflation expectations remain contained  nevertheless possible increases in resource utilization as well as elevated energy prices have the potential to add to inflation pressures  the committee judges that some further measured policy firming is likely to be needed to keep the risks to the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance  in any event the committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to foster these objectives
