       the federal open market committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate unchanged at 1 14 percent  while incoming economic data since the january meeting have been mixed recent labor market indicators have proven disappointing  however the hesitancy of the economic expansion appears to owe importantly to oil price premiums and other aspects of geopolitical uncertainties  the committee believes that as those uncertainties lift as most analysts expect the accommodative stance of monetary policy coupled with ongoing growth in productivity will provide support to economic activity sufficient to engender an improving economic climate over time  in light of the unusually large uncertainties clouding the geopolitical situation in the short run and their apparent effects on economic decisionmaking the committee does not believe it can usefully characterize the current balance of risks with respect to the prospects for its long run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth  rather the committee decided to refrain from making that determination until some of those uncertainties abate  in the current circumstances heightened surveillance is particularly informative
