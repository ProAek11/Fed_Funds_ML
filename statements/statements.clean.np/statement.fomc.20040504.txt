       the federal open market committee decided today to keep its target for     the federal funds rate at 1 percent     the committee continues to believe that an accommodative stance of monetary     policy coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity is providing     important ongoing support to economic activity the evidence accumulated     over the intermeeting period indicates that output is continuing to expand     at a solid rate and hiring appears to have picked up although incoming     inflation data have moved somewhat higher long term inflation expectations     appear to have remained well contained      the committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the attainment     of sustainable growth for the next few quarters are roughly equal similarly      the risks to the goal of price stability have moved into balance at this     juncture with inflation low and resource use slack the committee believes     that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be     measured
