      the federal open market committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate unchanged at 1 14 percent  the committee continues to believe that this accommodative stance of monetary policy coupled with still robust underlying growth in productivity is providing important ongoing support to economic activity  the limited number of incoming economic indicators since the november meeting taken together are not inconsistent with the economy working its way through its current soft spot  in these circumstances the committee believes that against the background of its long run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available the risks are balanced with respect to the prospects for both goals for the foreseeable future
