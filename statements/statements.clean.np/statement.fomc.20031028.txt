      the federal open market committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 1 percent   the committee continues to believe that an accommodative stance of monetary policy coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity is providing important ongoing support to economic activity  the evidence accumulated over the intermeeting period confirms that spending is firming and the labor market appears to be stabilizing  business pricing power and increases in core consumer prices remain muted   the committee perceives that the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth for the next few quarters are roughly equal  in contrast the probability though minor of an unwelcome fall in inflation exceeds that of a rise in inflation from its already low level  the committee judges that on balance the risk of inflation becoming undesirably low remains the predominant concern for the foreseeable future  in these circumstances the committee believes that policy accommodation can be maintained for a considerable period
